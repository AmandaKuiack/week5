            My name is Amanda Kuiack, and I am in Set 1C of the CIT program here
            at BCIT. I have always been curious about computers, software, and
            video games; however, I am also very artistic. I love to draw,
            paint, work in photoshop, fold origami, and recently started casting
            jewelry and home decor in resin. Resin is actually really fun to
            work with, but also <strong>very dangerous</strong> due to the
            fumes. But it is cool to create a 3D piece of art that you can share
            with others. My parents were always certain I was going to be an
            artist, <em>but</em> growing up I wanted to work in the video game
            industry. I wanted to model characters and create textures and
            design levels. <em>Unfortunately,</em> I graduated during the 2008
            recession. Without a job, I went back to school to change careers to
            get a job in the hospitality industry instead. I worked at a Spa
            chain in Vacouver for almost <b>8 years</b> and became an Assistant
            Manager at one of their many locations. Thanks to the pandemic I was
            able to rethink my career after many months of feeling burnt out. I
            didn't want to return to Video Games, and after my dad had almost
            fallen victim to a software security scam, I decided I wanted to
            work towards a career in <b>cybersecurity</b>. So I upgrading my
            Math grades and applied for BCIT!
